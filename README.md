# Unity week 4: Colliders and Triggers

In my adaptation of Erel's game, I added a damage system to the player's spaceship.  In order for the ship to be destroyed, the player needs to be hit by enemies 3 times.  

In addition, in my original change, I added a mechanic spaceship. When the player's ship collide with the mechanics, it gets an extra damage point (The opposite of what happens when colliding with an enemy).
